MATLAB codes for the manuscript "Numerical analysis of a first-order computational algorithm for reaction-diffusion equations via the primal-dual hybrid gradient method"

All the numerical solutions are solved from the time-implicit schemes of the reaction-diffusion equation with periodic boundary conditions by using the proposed primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method.

In each folder, please call the function `PDHG_PDE_solver` to compute the numerical solutions of certain reaction-diffusion equations. In the folder "PDHG method with adaptive time step size", please call the function `PDHG_PDE_solver_adaptive_time_stepsize` to compute the equation with adaptive time step sizes.

The detailed descriptions of our code can be found in the comments of each MATLAB file.
